# BI-Assignment
The BI Assignment for HotelQuickyl interview process

The **BI-Assignment** repository is divided into two subfolders are required. 
1. Datamart and ETL
2. Data-Cleaning.

Each of the subfolders, contain the required scripts, which will help you in understanding the assignment.
I have written the proper comments in the code as well as a descriptive summary in the Readme.md file, where and when was necessary.

With regards to the above assignment, there are various ways to achieve the same,multiple approached to do the same. I have used the best possible approaches for a problem. But I do agree that more optimization is always possible.

Please feel free to point out issues in my assignemt. Some helpful guidance is always welcome.

Regards,
Amar
